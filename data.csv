shrimp-cannellini-bean-salad,,20 mins,4 servings,"1 1/2 pounds large shrimp, shelled/n1/2 cup olive oil, divided/n2 cloves garlic, minced/n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, divided/n1 small onion, minced/n1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley/n1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage leaves, or 1 1/2 teaspoons dried sage/n1 tablespoon wine vinegar/n1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper/n3 1/3 cups drained and rinsed cannellini beans (two 15-ounce cans)","Step 1: Light the grill or heat the broiler. Thread the shrimp onto four skewers. In a shallow glass dish, combine 1/4 cup of the oil with the garlic and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Add the skewers and turn to coat the shrimp. Set aside./nStep 2: In a medium bowl, combine the onion with the remaining 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt, the parsley, sage, vinegar, and pepper. Gently stir in the beans./nStep 3: Grill or broil the shrimp, turning once, until just done, about 5 minutes in all. Serve the shrimp with the bean salad./nStep 4: Test kitchen tip: We put the shrimp on skewers before grilling so that they don't fall through the grate. If you don't have metal skewers, the disposable wooden ones work just fine. Soak them in water for 10 or 15 minutes before using them so that they don't burn up. Or you could use a grilling basket./nStep 5: The beans and the shrimp require a white with good body and full flavor. Tocai Friulano gives you both, while at the same time contributing a lively acidity that refreshes the palate.",https://www.foodandwine.com/thmb/kdZIArlcpRYjlqZOCshbAYu6Bto=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/201003-xl-shrimp-with-cannellini-bean-salad-2000-c831c3821d614a518ab59572d9ffecf9.jpg

Peel off and discard outer layer of bulbs. Remove and discard any dry, papery skin from pale green and dark green stalks. Trim and discard any roots. If any bulbs are 3/4 inch round or larger, cut bulb in half lengthwise, cutting into the pale green stalk just a little bit and keeping the stalk intact. (If using a white onion, peel onion, halve it lengthwise, and thinly slice with the grain, following the curve of the onion to keep the slices similar in size.) Set aside./nStep 2: Working with 1 nopal at a time, place nopal flat on a work surface. Hold the base of the paddle with a clean kitchen towel. Using a sharp paring knife, trim about 1/4 inch off the entire perimeter of the paddle; discard. If base of paddle is tough, cut off and discard. Using a sharp knife, scrape off any thorny spines on each side of paddle, being careful not to shave off too much cactus skin. Rinse paddle under cold water, and pat dry with paper towels. Starting about 1 inch from base of each cleaned paddle, make 3 or 4 lengthwise cuts through paddle and toward top of paddle, spacing cuts 1 inch apart. Halve jalapeños lengthwise, keeping stems intact. (Do not remove seeds.)/nStep 3: Heat a large cast-iron comal or a 2-burner cast-iron griddle over high heat until comal is smoking, 5 to 7 minutes.

Remove from the oven and set aside./nStep 2: Meanwhile, make a quick squash stock, combine the squash peelings and scraps, roughly chopped onion, celery, peppercorns, and bay leaves in a 3 quart saucepot with 6 cups of water. Slowly bring the stock to a boil. Once it comes up to a boil, turn off the heat. Let it sit warm on the stove and after 20 minutes, strain out the solids and pour it back into the saucepot. Cover and keep hot over low heat./nStep 3: In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil and 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter.

Add enough of the hot butternut stock just to cover the rice; cook while stirring, until the stock is almost absorbed. Repeat with about 5 additions of stock until the rice is al dente and bound in a creamy consistency, about 25 minutes. There should be about a 1/2 cup of stock remaining, keep it hot and reserve./nStep 4: When the rice is cooked, remove from the heat and carefully fold in a 1/2 cup of Parmesan, the remaining 2 1/2 tablespoons of butter, and roasted squash. Add the reserved stock to loosen and let the whole pan rest for a few minutes./nStep 5: Meanwhile, in a heavy bottomed frying pan over medium to high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil until it begins to shimmer in the pan. Make sure the prawns are dry, and season with kosher salt. Once the oil is hot, drop them into the pan. Cook for 1-2 minutes on each side until the shells are brightly colored and have slightly charred. Turn off the heat, add a tablespoon of butter to glaze the shrimp and set aside./nStep 6: To serve, give the risotto a quick stir and taste to adjust for seasonings. Spoon onto plates, and place a few shrimp onto each serving of risotto. Sprinkle with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano and freshly cracked black pepper, and drizzle with a touch extra virgin olive oil.

Add the onion, reduce the heat to low, and sauté until golden and transparent, approximately 10–15 minutes.

Cut the cuttlefish into 1 centimeter (1/2 inch) cubes./nStep 3: Add the diced cuttlefish to the sautéed garlic and onion and season well with salt and pepper. Sauté the cuttlefish until all the liquid that has been released has evaporated and the cuttlefish starts to stick to the bottom of the pan, caramelising slightly. Add the tomato paste and cook for a few seconds, then add the white wine and cook until the liquid has almost completely evaporated.

Alternatively, omit the potato, which will give the bottom rice a nice golden crunchy layer (called tahdig)./nStep 3: Scoop 1/3 of the rice into the pot, being careful not to shake the pot so that the rice doesn’t compact. Cover the rice with 1/3 of the chopped herbs. Spoon in another 1/3 of the rice, then another 1/3 of the herbs. Finally, add the remaining rice. Mix the melted butter (or ghee) with the crushed saffron, then pour over the rice in a circular pattern./nStep 4: Wrap the stockpot lid in a kitchen towel, then cover. Cook on medium-high heat for 5 minutes, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 40 minutes. Uncover and carefully stir together with a spatula, then stir in the final 1/3 of the fresh herbs./nStep 5: In a skillet, warm the ghee or coconut oil over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Combine the tapioca starch, salt, pepper and turmeric in a shallow pan. Dredge the fish fillets in the tapioca starch mixture one at a time, shaking off any excess starch. Add the fillets to the skillet (cook in batches if needed; don’t overcrowd the skillet). Cook for 3 minutes, carefully flip the fish, then continue to cook until the fish is done, about 3 more minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets./nStep 6: The fish is done when it just starts to flake (it will finish cooking when removed from the heat). If cooking the fish in batches, add more ghee/oil with each batch. Serve over the herbed rice.",https://www.foodandwine.com/thmb/WON8Tehv4mm7uBYNi2uvlflh6Jo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/xl-sabzi-polo-ba-mahi-47795e8dfc9a4e618b785f6d01090667.jpg

Porterhouse steaks have more tenderloin and T-bones have a larger strip loin section.

When it’s warm, add the onion and garlic and sauté, stirring often, for 5 minutes. When the onion starts to become translucent, add the tomato paste, curry powder, paprika, cayenne, cinnamon, and allspice. Stir to combine and cook for 1 minute./nStep 2: Add the diced tomatoes, maple syrup, and vinegar and season with the salt and black pepper. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered, for 30 to 35 minutes, until reduced and thickened. Give the ketchup a stir every few minutes so it doesn’t catch./nStep 3: Remove from the heat and pulse in a blender until smooth (or puree directly in the pot using an immersion blender). Let cool completely, transfer to a jar, and refrigerate overnight so all those flavors can really get to know each other./nStep 4: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the flour, yeast, sugar, salt, and water. Crack in five of the eggs and beat on low speed for 3 to 4 minutes, until all the ingredients are combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Knead the dough for 3 minutes more to make sure those ingredients are getting extra cozy./nStep 5: Cut the butter into 1/2-inch cubes. With the mixer running on low, add the butter one piece at a time, until it works itself into the dough. This will take a few minutes. Perfect time to grab a coffee, check your e-mail, or stage a sweet Instagram snap. The dough will be quite wet at this stage, but fear not!/nStep 6: When all the butter has worked itself into the dough, turn the mixer to high and let it go to town, kneading the dough for 10 minutes. The side of the bowl should be clean, and the dough ball should be making a slapping sound against it./nStep 7: Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled large bowl, cover, and let rise slowly in the fridge overnight./nStep 8: The next day, let the dough sit out for 30 minutes or so to come to room temperature. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper./nStep 9: Lightly dust a work surface with flour and place the dough on it. Using a kitchen scale, divide the dough into sixteen equal 3.15-ounce pieces (if need be, make 14 or 15 balls instead to get them to the right size). Using the palm of your hand, roll a piece of dough on the floured surface in a clockwise motion for about 1 minute. A perfect little dough ball will naturally form as it rolls on the counter. Pinch off the bottom of the dough ball to close it if necessary. As you finish each ball, place it on one of the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 1 1/2 inches between each ball./nStep 10: Cover the baking sheets with plastic wrap and let the dough rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour./nStep 11: Preheat the oven to 350°F./nStep 12: Crack and beat the remaining egg in a small dish. Brush the top of each dough ball with the egg, covering all sides. Repeat with a second coat of egg. You can either top each bun with 1 teaspoon sesame seeds or leave them plain. Choose your own adventure./nStep 13: Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until deeply golden brown. Let cool on a wire rack for a few minutes before serving. These brioche buns are best eaten the same day, but will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for 2 to 3 days./nStep 14: In a large bowl, combine the ground chuck and sirloin and mix gently but thoroughly. Divide into eight equal portions and shape them into burger patties (see opposite for tips). Season both sides with salt and pepper and refrigerate for 30 minutes./nStep 15: Preheat the oven to 350°F./nStep 16: Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Split and toast the buns in the pan until toasty and golden brown. Set aside./nStep 17: Remove the burgers from the fridge and place a thumbprint in the center of each patty. Smear 1 teaspoon of the mustard on both sides of each patty (best burger crust ever). Melt the butter in the preheated pan and, working in batches, fry the burgers for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until a dark brown crust begins to form. The result: perfectly juicy medium-cooked burgers. For folks who prefer their burgers a little more well done, fry for 5 to 6 minutes per side./nStep 18: Transfer the patties to a baking sheet as they’re done. Top each with cheese and place in the oven to melt, 2 to 3 minutes./nStep 19: Build the burgers on the toasted buns with 1 or 2 burger patties, a slice of tomato, pickles, a slice of red onion, and lettuce. Top each with ketchup or mayo. Or both. Serve immediately./nStep 20: The ketchup will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 month./nStep 21: From Eat Delicious by Dennis Prescott.

Rub the pork belly on both sides with the oil, season with salt and pepper and set it on a rack in a medium roasting pan. Add the stock to the pan, cover and roast the pork for about 2 1/2 hours, until very tender. Let the pork rest for 30 minutes. Strain the rendered fat through a cheesecloth-lined sieve into a bowl; the stock will have evaporated. Cut the pork into 1/2-inch-thick slices and keep warm./nStep 2: In a large saucepan, heat the oil. Add the onion and eggplant and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are very soft, about 1 hour. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have almost melted, about 1 hour. Stir in the chipotle powder and cook for 15 minutes longer; season with salt. Transfer the sofrito to a bowl and let cool to room temperature. Drain the sofrito in a sieve; discard the oil or reserve it for another use./nStep 3: In a medium saucepan, heat the oil.

Add the soy sauce, sake and mirin and bring to a boil; simmer for 2 minutes. Add the stock and dashi powder and simmer for 3 minutes. Keep warm./nStep 4: Preheat the oven to 275°. In a small ovenproof skillet lined with aluminum foil, spread the baking soda in an even layer and bake for 1 hour. Let cool./nStep 5: Meanwhile, in a small nonstick skillet, toast the rye flour over moderately low heat, stirring, until fragrant, about 4 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, scrape the toasted rye flour into the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add the bread flour and cake flour. In a medium bowl, stir the baked baking soda and salt with the cool water until dissolved. With the mixer at low speed, slowly blend the baking soda solution into the flour in three additions. Mix, scraping down the bowl frequently, until the dough starts to come together. At medium speed, knead the dough until it forms a shaggy ball, about 10 minutes. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes./nStep 6: Pat the dough into a disk and cut into 8 equal pieces. Work with 1 piece at a time and keep the rest covered with a damp kitchen towel: Flatten the dough about 1/4 inch thick. Roll the dough through a pasta machine at the widest setting. Fold the dough in thirds, like a letter, and roll it again at the widest setting. Repeat this folding and rolling until the dough feels smooth and elastic, about 3 more times. Roll the dough through successively narrower settings, two times per setting without folding, until the sheet of dough is 1/16 inch thick. Cut the sheet of dough into roughly 1-foot lengths and transfer them to a baking sheet or work sur-face lightly dusted with cornstarch. Lightly dust the pasta sheets with cornstarch and cover with a dry kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining dough, slightly overlapping the pasta sheets on the baking sheet./nStep 7: Run each sheet of pasta through the spaghetti cutter. Gently toss the noodles with cornstarch and spread them on a baking sheet or work surface in a single layer in 8 even portions (roughly 5 ounces each)./nStep 8: To build a bowl of ramen: Pour 1/3 cup of the warm shoyu tare and 1 teaspoon of the reserved rendered pork fat into a bowl. Boil one portion of noodles in unsalted water just until al dente, about 1 minute. (If you're assembling multiple bowls of ramen, you can cook up to 4 portions of noodles together at the same time.) Drain the noodles well and add to the bowl. Top with 1/4 cup of the chile-eggplant sofrito and a slice or two of pork belly. Garnish with scallions and chipotle powder./nStep 9: The pork belly and its rendered fat, chile-eggplant sofrito and shoyu tare can be refrigerated separately for up to 3 days. The 5-ounce portions of noodles can be refrigerated overnight in individual resealable plastic bags or frozen for up to 2 weeks.

Turn dough out onto a clean work surface. Shape into a ball, and knead until smooth, about 3 minutes. Wrap dough tightly in plastic wrap. Let stand at room temperature at least 1 hours and 30 minutes or up to 4 hours./nStep 2: Set rollers of a pasta machine on widest setting. Unwrap dough, and cut in half. Rewrap one dough half. Use a rolling pin or your hands, flatten unwrapped dough portion to 1/3-inch thickness. Roll dough through pasta machine, flouring dough as needed to prevent sticking. Fold dough in half crosswise; reroll through pasta machine. Continue folding dough in half crosswise and rerolling until it is as wide as the pasta rollers (5 to 6 inches), 1 or 2 times. Trim dough as needed to create straight sides. Once width is reached, run dough sheet through widest setting once more to ensure even thickness of dough. Reduce width of rollers one setting, and roll dough through rollers. Measure dough length, and trim to 32 inches, reserving scraps. Continue rerolling dough (do not refold) through pasta machine, reducing width of rollers one setting at a time and trimming to 32 inches between settings, until dough is the thickness of 3 pieces of paper and dough sheet weighs approximately 6 ounces. Trim pasta sheet into a 32- x 5-inch rectangle. Cover pasta sheet and scraps with plastic wrap or a towel. Repeat process with remaining dough half to form 2 (32- x 5-inch) sheets of pasta and about 6 ounces of dough scraps./nStep 3: Bring a large pot of water to boil, and salt it. Add 1 pasta sheet to boiling water; cook 1 minute. Using a spider and tongs, gently transfer pasta to a baking sheet generously coated with oil. Coat pasta generously all over with oil to prevent sticking; fold in half crosswise. Repeat process using remaining pasta sheet. Set aside./nStep 4: Process Parmigiano-Reggiano chunks in a food processor until finely ground into small crumbles, about 30 seconds. Transfer half of the cheese (about 3/4 cup) to a bowl, and reserve for finishing lasagna. Add ricotta, prosciutto, cream, and rosemary to food processor; pulse until well combined and prosciutto is very finely chopped, about 10 pulses. Season with salt to taste. Transfer filling to a large piping bag with a 3/4-inch hole snipped in the tip./nStep 5: Coat a 9- x 5-inch loaf pan with oil. Unfold pasta sheets, and arrange them parallel, overlapping them to create a 9-inch-wide layer of pasta. Line the bottom and two long sides of the loaf pan with the pasta, allowing a 5-inch overhang on one side and the remaining long ends on the other./nStep 6: Pipe a 1 1/4-inch-thick line of filling along the long pan side with the long ends of the pasta. Pipe a second line of filling parallel to the first, leaving 1/2 inch space on each side of the second line. Carefully fold the long overhanging pasta sheets up and over filling; press the pasta down to hug sides of filling. (This creates 2 long pockets of filling.) Pipe 2 lines of filling in the “trenches” of the pasta. Fold the longer pasta sheets back up and over the filling; gently press down to smooth./nStep 7: Repeat Step 7 once for a total of 4 layers of filling. Fold the 5-inch pasta overhang up and over to seal the lasagna. Trim pasta sheets along upper lip of loaf pan. Wrap loaf pan in plastic wrap, pressing plastic wrap directly onto lasagna surface. Chill until set, at least 6 hours or up to 24 hours./nStep 8: Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil, and salt it. Add spinach; cook, stirring occasionally, until very tender, about 2 minutes. Using a spider, transfer spinach to a large bowl of ice water. Let cool 2 minutes. Drain and squeeze excess moisture from spinach. Transfer spinach to a blender; add 1/2 cup water. Process until smooth, about 30 seconds, adding up to an additional 1/3 cup water, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed to thin sauce to consistency of heavy cream. Transfer mixture to a small saucepan. Stir in oil and salt. Keep warm over low, stirring often, until ready to use./nStep 9: Preheat oven to 500°F. Run a small offset spatula around edges of lasagna to loosen from pan. Unmold lasagna, and invert onto a cutting board; cut crosswise into 6 (1 1/2-inch-wide) slices. Arrange lasagna slices, cut sides up, on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving at least 1 inch between slices. Brush tops and sides of slices evenly with oil. Sprinkle slices with reserved Parmigiano-Reggiano crumbles (about 2 tablespoons per slice). Bake in preheated oven until slices are heated through and edges are puffy and golden brown, 6 to 10 minutes./nStep 10: Spoon 2 tablespoons spinach sauce onto each of 6 plates; tilt each plate in a circular motion to spread sauce in a thin, even layer. (Reserve remaining sauce for another use.) Place 1 lasagna slice on each plate. Serve immediately./nStep 11: Dough can be chilled overnight before rolling. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before rolling. Lasagna can be assembled up to 24 hours in advance. The spinach sauce can be made up to 1 day in advance and reheated, adding a splash of water to thin if needed. To freeze, follow steps 1 through 8 as directed. Run a small offset spatula around edges of the lasagna to loosen from pan. Unmold lasagna, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and cover with aluminum foil. Freeze lasagna up to 3 weeks. To thaw, transfer lasagna to the fridge for 24 hours. Unwrap and proceed with step 9, disregarding unmolding instructions./nStep 12: Prosciutto may be substituted with 1 cup of mushroom duxelles. To make duxelles, finely chop 1 lb. fresh mushrooms and saute in ¼ cup butter, stirring often, until mushrooms are cooked and all their liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Season generously with salt and pepper, and let cool before adding to filling./nStep 13: Cool-climate Friulian red.",https://www.foodandwine.com/thmb/8JFSBdcYZvJjNhm8g2f60Swcj9g=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/woven-lasagna-with-prosciutto-and-fresh-spinach-sauce-ft-recipe0520-1-ce2b6656e4754478a2fd1e56771e5e95.jpg

Transfer 1 dough ball to a heavily floured surface. Using floured fingertips, firmly press all over dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border./nStep 2: If cooking in your home oven, preheat to 500°F with a baking steel or large round cast-iron pizza pan (such as Lodge 15-inch) on middle rack. Let pan preheat in oven for about 30 minutes. If using an outdoor pizza oven, preheat pizza oven and pizza stone according to manufacturer's instructions on high 20 minutes. (Note: Cooking with wood takes more experience to control the heat, so we've only included instructions for gas oven cooking here.)/nStep 3: Form a C-shape with the outer edge of your hand, and press firmly inside dough border to define a 1/2-inch wide ring around edge of dough. Lift dough onto the knuckles of both hands, and gently stretch, rotating dough after each stretch to maintain its round shape. Continue gently stretching dough, allowing gravity to help it expand, until a 10-inch circle of even thickness forms, with a slightly thicker outer ring. Lay dough round on a semolina-dusted pizza peel, reshaping as needed to form a circle. Spread dough round with crème fraîche and 4 smashed garlic confit. Layer with potato, onions, bacon, and baby kale./nStep 4: Gently shake pizza peel with prepared pie to loosen. If pizza feels stuck in any areas, carefully lift pizza edge with a bench scraper, and dust peel with a 1:1 mixture of semolina and bread flour. Unload pizza onto preheated pan in home oven, or into stone in outdoor pizza oven using quick, decisive movements: Set the peel edge on the pan at about a 20-degree angle, and quickly pull back peel to slide half of the pizza onto the pan. Gently shake the peel side to side while pulling it back to slide the rest of the pizza onto the pan, allowing it to stretch slightly./nStep 5: If baking in a home oven, bake at 500°F until edges of crust have puffed slightly, about 3 minutes. Rotate pan 90 degrees, and increase oven temperature to broil. Broil until pizza is cooked through and crust is browned, 3 to 6 minutes. If baking in an outdoor pizza oven, cook pizza, using peel to rotate pizza 90 degrees every 20 to 30 seconds, until cooked through and crust is risen and charred in spots, 2 to 4 minutes./nStep 6: Using peel, transfer pizza to a cutting board. Garnish with chives, and cut into wedges./nStep 7: Get the Recipe: Garlic Confit",https://www.foodandwine.com/thmb/jhGQ1tbOEbzBr8mjf0bVDZhkaMA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/potato-pizza-with-creme-fraiche-and-bacon-FT-RECIPE0422-031b54754b8d49eb93a5cac9e83ff4c0.jpg

Transfer the turkey to a carving board and leave to rest in a warm spot for about 10 minutes. Cut the turkey into slices./nStep 4: Test-Kitchen Tip Sometimes boneless turkey breasts come rolled and tied like a roast. For this preparation, you'll want to unroll the breast and put it flat in the roasting pan, thereby cutting the cooking time significantly./nStep 5: A moist and creamy side dish—mashed potatoes or sweet potatoes, baked squash, or creamed corn or spinach—is the perfect foil for the turkey./nStep 6: The mild flavors of this dish provide an opportunity to explore a full-flavored red wine.

Cook until the turkey is just done, about 1 1/2 minutes./nStep 5: Turkey OptionsIf you like, buy a three-quarter-pound piece of cooked turkey breast from the deli to use instead of the turkey cutlets. Cut the turkey into half-inch cubes and heat it in the soup briefly. Another option is to use leftover cooked turkey or chicken. About two cups of cubed leftovers should do it./nStep 6: Sweet wines are said not to work at the table, but when the dish contains sweet elements, the wine often should, too.

Add mochiko, cake flour, sugar, 3 tablespoons strawberry powder, baking powder, and salt. Stir until mixture is smooth and well combined, about 1 minute. (Dough will look dry and crumbly at first, but tofu will hydrate mixture, allowing it to come together into a ball.)/nStep 2: Pour oil into a large Dutch oven to a depth of 2 inches; heat over medium to 350°F. Meanwhile, cut 8 (5-inch) squares of parchment paper; set aside. Divide dough evenly into 8 pieces (about 31/2 ounces each). Cover with a damp paper towel to prevent drying. Working with 1 dough piece at a time and keeping remaining pieces covered, divide dough piece evenly into 7 pieces (about 1/2 ounce each). Roll each piece into a ball, and arrange balls in a 3-inch ring on 1 prepared parchment square, ensuring adjacent balls are touching so that the ring holds together while frying.

Beat cream cheese and butter with a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on high speed until smooth, about 1 minute, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed. Reduce mixer speed to low; add one-third flour mixture. Beat on low speed until flour mixture is incorporated, about 20 seconds. Repeat process twice with remaining flour mixture, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed. Increase mixer speed to medium-high, and beat until Dough is as smooth as possible, about 1 minute. If necessary, knead Dough in bowl until it comes together./nStep 2: Roll Dough into a thick log on a well floured surface using floured hands. Cut into 3 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball; flatten into a circular disk. Wrap disks separately in plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours./nStep 3: Process walnuts, dates, sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, and lemon zest in a food processor until nuts and dates are finely chopped but not a paste, 20 to 30 seconds, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed.

Transfer to a small bowl. Add peanuts to skillet, and cook, stirring constantly, until glossy and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a separate small bowl. Toast sesame seeds in skillet, stirring constantly, until seeds are fragrant and darken a few shades past their natural bone color, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a separate small bowl./nStep 2: Cook guajillo chile and chiles de árbol in same skillet over medium-low, flipping and moving chiles constantly to avoid burning, which will make them bitter, until skins darken a few shades and turn glossy, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer chiles to a bowl. Add garlic to skillet, and cook, turning often, until fragrant and golden in spots, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer garlic to bowl with chiles. Add spring onion greens and bulbs to skillet, and cook, turning occasionally, until greens are softened and wilted and bulbs are lightly charred all over, about 3 minutes for greens and 8 to 10 minutes for bulbs. Transfer to a cutting board to let cool. Once cool enough to handle, roughly chop bulbs; set aside./nStep 3: Grind sesame seeds into a coarse powder using a mortar and pestle or a metate (see Note). Repeat grinding procedure with pepitas and peanuts. If using a food processor, process each ingredient separately for about 30 seconds./nStep 4: Combine the 3 powders in a food processor. With food processor running, gradually add 1 cup chicken stock, and process until mixture forms a coarse paste, about 30 seconds. Add chiles and garlic. Process until mostly incorporated, about 30 seconds. Add spring onion greens and chopped bulbs. With processor running, gradually add 1/2 cup chicken stock, and process until mixture resembles slightly grainy peanut butter, 1 to 2 minutes. Add salt, and pulse until combined, about 5 pulses./nStep 5: Bring 4 cups chicken stock to a boil in a large, well-seasoned clay casserole dish (cazuela) or 4-quart Dutch oven over medium-high. Stir in nut and seed mixture, and return to a boil over medium-high, stirring occasionally. While mixture comes to a boil, whisk together masa and remaining 1/4 cup chicken stock in a small bowl./nStep 6: Reduce heat to medium-low, and gradually stir in masa mixture. Allow the pipián to simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, 15 to 25 minutes. It should be looser than a porridge but thicker than a soup; the surface should splutter as the mixture slowly reduces./nStep 7: When ready to serve, return the pipián to a boil over medium-high, stirring occasionally, adding chicken stock as needed to thin to desired consistency. Once boiling, stir in leaves from 5 yerba buena sprigs (about 1/4 cup). Boil 2 minutes. Stir in sorrel, and cook, stirring occasionally, until greens are wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt to taste. Garnish with remaining yerba buena sprig. Serve directly on the plate with tortillas, or, for a heartier meal, use as a sauce for fried short ribs, pork chops, or chicken thighs./nStep 8: Pipián can be prepared through step 6 and cooled, covered, and refrigerated up to 1 day ahead./nStep 9: To substitute masa harina for fresh masa, stir together 1/3 cup (1 1/8 ounces) masa harina (we tested with Masienda brand) and 1/4 cup water. Whisk together with an additional 1/4 cup chicken stock or water before adding to the pipián./nStep 10: Traditionally, the seeds and nuts in this recipe are ground using a metate, a grinding stone made from volcanic rock similar to a mortar and pestle.

Add milk, 2 tablespoons at a time; you may need a bit more or less than 1/2 cup to adhere ingredients into a thick, cohesive mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes./nStep 2: Process mint chutney ingredients in a blender on low speed, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. Add water, a tablespoon at a time, to help blend the ingredients, if needed./nStep 3: Shape crab cake mixture into 12 patties, about 3 inches in diameter and 1-inch thick. Coat with additional breadcrumbs./nStep 4: Fill a large, deep skillet with 1/4 inch oil, and place over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, test for readiness by dropping a loose kernel of corn into it—if the oil sizzles and tiny bubbles form around the kernel, the oil is ready. Gently fry the patties in batches, turning them over halfway through to brown on each side. Do not crowd the pan and use two spatulas to turn. Cook 3 to 5 minutes on each side./nStep 5: Lay the fried patties on a few paper towels to absorb excess oil. Season with salt. Serve hot, with mint chutney on the side./nStep 6: Amchur is a light, sawdust-brown powder made of sun-dried green mangoes. It's a great souring agent when you don't want to add moisture to a dish.

Cut lemon in half crosswise; thinly slice 1 lemon half. Reserve remaining lemon half for another use./nStep 2: Peel away and discard outer layer of each leek, and trim the hairy roots, leaving root ends attached. Place 1 leek on a cutting board with white end of the leek pointing away from you. To remove dark green part of leek, cut it at an angle, then roll the leek 90 degrees to repeat the same cut. Continue rolling and cutting in this manner until the tapered pale green end of leek resembles a sharpened pencil. Discard dark green leek trimmings. Cut leek lengthwise into quarters. Rinse to remove fine grit between each layer, and pat dry. Repeat process with remaining leek./nStep 3: Place leeks in a 3-quart baking dish. Drizzle evenly with 1/4 cup of the oil; sprinkle evenly with salt and pepper to taste; toss to coat. Pour in chicken stock. Drizzle evenly with remaining 1/2 cup oil. Arrange lemon slices over leeks, and scatter with thyme sprigs. Cover baking dish tightly with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven until leeks are very tender, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven, and increase oven temperature to 400ºF. Remove and discard foil from baking dish. Remove and discard lemon slices and thyme sprigs. Return leeks to oven, and bake at 400°F until leeks are glazed and golden brown and liquid has evaporated, 1 hour to 1 hour, 15 minutes. Set aside at room temperature until ready to use. Braised Leeks may be stored in an airtight container in refrigerator up to 5 days./nStep 4: Whisk together shallot, lemon juice, vinegar, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Let stand 10 minutes. Gradually add oil in a slow, steady stream, whisking constantly until emulsified. Whisk in Parmesan cheese, garlic, and lemon zest. Store in an airtight container in refrigerator up to 5 days./nStep 5: Whisk together vinegar and lemon juice in a small bowl. Whisk together canola oil and olive oil in a small measuring cup. Place egg yolk in a medium bowl. Wet a clean kitchen towel, and drape over a medium saucepan to cover; place bowl with egg yolk on top of towel. This will help hold the bowl in place. Whisk egg yolk until pale yellow, 2 to 3 minutes. Add salt and garlic; whisk to combine./nStep 6: Add oil mixture 1 drop at a time, whisking constantly, until oil and egg are emulsified; you will have added 2 or 3 tablespoons of oil mixture. Add 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice mixture, and whisk to combine. Drizzle remaining oil mixture in a slow, steady stream, whisking constantly and stopping when mayonnaise thickens to add remaining lemon juice mixture, until you've added all the oil. Whisk in remaining lemon juice mixture, if there is any. Aïoli may be stored in an airtight container in refrigerator up to 3 days./nStep 7: Rinse anchovies under cold water to remove salt. Place anchovies in a small bowl, and cover with cold water. Let soak until anchovy flesh softens slightly, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain and gently pat anchovies dry. Using a paring knife, cut each anchovy lengthwise into 2 fillets. Gently lift out spines and discard. Stir together anchovy fillets, oil, parsley, and lemon zest in a small bowl. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour./nStep 8: Meanwhile, bring 8 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan over high. Add salt. (The salt helps the egg whites solidify quickly if a shell cracks). Gently add eggs; simmer, undisturbed, for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, fill a medium bowl with ice water; set aside. Remove pan from heat; let eggs stand in water 5 minutes. Remove 1 ""tester"" egg, and crack it open to see if it's cooked to perfection — white and the outer rim of the yolk should be cooked through, while the innermost portion of yolk should be bright yellow and slightly wet looking. If the yolk is runny and wet looking, let eggs stand in hot water up to 2 additional minutes. Transfer eggs to prepared ice water; let cool completely, about 10 minutes. Peel eggs, and cut into thin slices. Set aside until ready to use./nStep 9: Preheat grill to medium-high (400°F to 450°F). Arrange bread on oiled grates; grill, uncovered, until toasted, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove from grill. Rub garlic clove evenly over 1 side of each bread slice./nStep 10: Spread about 2 tablespoons Aïoli over the garlic side of each bread slice. Cut each bread slice in half diagonally, and divide evenly among 6 plates. Cut 4 Braised Leek pieces diagonally into thirds; arrange evenly on top of bread pieces, fanning them out slightly. Reserve remaining leeks for another use. Arrange egg slices evenly on top of leeks. Top each bread piece with 2 anchovy fillets, and drizzle with some of the anchovy marinade. Sprinkle evenly with chives./nStep 11: Toss together lettuce leaves and 3/4 cup Garlic-Parmesan Vinaigrette in a medium bowl. Massage each leaf with vinaigrette to ensure every leaf is dressed evenly.
